## How to run the project

- **Development**
  
  Runs the app in the development mode.\
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

  The page will reload when you make changes.\
  You may also see any lint errors in the console.

  ```shell
  npm start
  # or
  yarn start
  ```

- **Test**
  
  Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
  See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

  ```shell
  npm test
  # or
  yarn test
  ```

- **Build**
  
  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
  It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
  Your app is ready to be deployed!

  ```shell
  npm run build
  # or
  yarn build
  ```
